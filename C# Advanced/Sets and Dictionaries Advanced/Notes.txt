How to sort dictionary:
.OrderBy(predicate).ToDictionary(x => x.Key, x => x.Value)

HashSet works with Hash Function and because of that is very quick.
HashFunction returns specific index when adding element. And when we search in the hashset, it really fast, 
because its doesnt search, it actually just gets the index for the element.
